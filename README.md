## Abstract
Resource adequacy studies look at balancing electricity supply and demand on 10- to 15-year time horizons while asset 
investment planning typically evaluates returns on 20- to 40-year time horizons. Projections of electricity demand are 
factored into the decision-making in both cases. Climate, energy policy, and socioeconomic changes are key uncertainties 
known to influence electricity demands, but their relative importance for demands over the next 10-40 years is unclear. 
The power sector would benefit from a better understanding of the need to characterize these uncertainties for resource 
adequacy and investment planning. In this study, we quantify when projected United States (U.S.) electricity demands 
start to meaningfully diverge in response to a range of climate, energy policy, and socioeconomic drivers. We use a wide 
yet plausible range of 21st century scenarios for the U.S. The projections span two population/economic growth scenarios 
(Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 3 and 5) and two climate/energy policy scenarios, one including climate mitigation 
policies and one without (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5). Each climate/energy policy scenario has 
two warming levels to reflect a range of climate model uncertainty. We show that the socioeconomic scenario matters 
almost immediately â€“ within the next 10 years, the climate/policy scenario matters within 25-30 years, and the climate 
model uncertainty matters only after 50+ years. This work can inform the power sector working to integrate climate 
change uncertainties into their decision-making.

### Output data
The output of the TELL model is stored in the data repository linked below. The post-processed files (resulting from the
analysis scripts itemized below) are stored in the /data directory in this meta-repository.

## Reproduce my experiment
Clone this repository to get access to the notebooks used to execute the TELL runs for this experiment. You'll also need 
to download the input files from the accompanying data repository (https://doi.org/10.57931/2228460) and the weather 
forcing data (https://doi.org/10.57931/1960530). Once you have the input datasets downloaded you can use the following 
notebooks to rerun the TELL model and produce the post-processed data used in this analysis. For the TELL runs you 
should only have to adjust the input directories to reflect the paths to wherever you choose to store the input files. 
The accompanying data repository already contains the output from the TELL model so you can skip rerunning the TELL 
model if you want to save time.
